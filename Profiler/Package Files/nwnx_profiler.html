<h3>I. What does this module do?</h3>

<h4>A. General introduction</h4>

<p> The "Profiler" is a NWNX module that spits out statistics about running 
scripts. It shows how often a script has been called, how much time it took to 
complete, and gives some overall statistics. This is especially useful if you 
want to identify scripts with performance problems, or want to determine which 
scripts should be put in the script cache.

<p>You do not need to put any special code in your scripts.... just copy the 
nwnx_profile.dll in your NWN directory, load up a module, and check the 
<b>logs.0</b> directory for <b>nwnx_profile.txt</b>. Every 10 seconds, this module will 
append the current statistics into this file, so remember to re-open it once in 
a while to get updated statistics.

<p><b>Licence</b><br> This module is distributed unter the terms of the GNU 
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE included in <a href="licence.txt">licence.txt</a>.

<h4>B. Changelog v1.1</h4>

<p>The original version 1.0 overlooked some scripts. First of all, nested scripts 
weren't correctly logged. A script which called another script with ExecuteScript() 
wasn't accounted at all. Props go out to FastFrench for pointing this out.

<p>Also, there was another script constellation that also went wrong in the previous 
version. When you call a function directly with ExecuteScript(1.0f, 
MyFunction()), not the whole script, but only a "part" of the script is 
executed, namely just that function. Version 1.1 takes this special case into 
consideration, too. "Partly" executed scripts are denoted with a '>' sign before the 
script name.

<h4>C. Changelog v1.2</h4>

<p>The timeing measurement should be more accurate now. Previous versions took 
the time it took for a script to be loaded by the server into memory into 
account (either from disk or from the disk cache), but since NWN can cache 
scripts now, the profiler only measures the real execution time. This means you 
will get somewhat lower accumulative times compared to previous versions.

<p>Note that scripts called via DelayCommand (e.g. DelayCommand(1.0f, 
ExecuteScript("myscript", OBJECT_SELF))) are counted twice, one time as a normal 
script call, and a second time as a "partly" called script. Thus when the line 
above is executed ten times, you will get two entries for this script: 10 times 
"myscript" and 10 times ">myscript". This is due to the way the NWN engine works 
and I currently do not know of a way to code around it.

<h4>D. Changelog v1.5</h4>

<p>Logfiles have a fixed size limit now, which can be set at compile time. In 
the binary distribution, a hard limit of 512 KByte has been chosen. If the log 
file exceeds this limit, it will be emptied and the profiler starts again with a 
clean file.

<p>During my tests, I found that pathfinding can be a big performance hog in 
NWN, especially under circumstances where creatures are blocked in a somewhat 
narrow space or where they are repeatedly trying to pathfind across several 
areas. Therefore, this updated version supports profiling the two pathfinding 
routines in NWN (that's a bit of a oversimplification, but that's how you can 
think of it). 

<p>There are two types of NPC pathfinding in NWN:
<ul>
<li>finding a path within an area (called <i>Tile pathfinding</i>)
<li>finding a path to another area (called <i>Cross area pathfinding</i>)
</ul>

<p>Pathfinding can't be totally avoided of course, but you should be able to 
considerably reduce CPU cycles wasted by useless pathfinding in your module. 
Useless pathfinding can happen for example, when you place a NPC inside a small 
confined space, e.g. four fence placeables laid out as a square. It can also 
happen if a NPC does waypoint walking and tries to reach a waypoint that exists 
in the module, but is not reachable on foot. You will see excessive pathfinding 
events in the log file in these cases. 

<p>For tile pathfinding events, the name of the area where the pathfinding is 
happening is written to the log file and marked with a dollar ($) symbol. For 
cross area pathfinding, it's the tag of the creature marked with an at (@) symbol.

<p>Another new feature: Updated entries are marked with a star (*) symbol. 
Previously, it was very hard to find out what scripts caused the delta in 
runtime between two logging events. Now it's easy to see which scripts eat up 
your valuable CPU cycles.

<h4>E. Changelog v1.6</h4>

<p>Support for NWNX.INI file has been added. There are two options that can be
configured:

<pre>
  [PROFILER]
  MaxLogSize = 512 ; in KByte
  LogLevel = 1 ; 1=overall statistics, 2=full script callstack
</pre>

<p>LogLevel 2 produces LOTS of output, be careful. Its main purpose is to help with 
identifying possible causes for server crashes.

<h3>II. Using the module</h3>

<h4>A. Running the NWNX Profiler on your module</h4>

<p>The nice thing about this NWNX module is that you don't need to modify anything. 
Just drop the .dll in the NWN directory.

<h4>B. The statistics</h4>

<p>The Profiler generates statistics that look like this:

<ul>
<li>The first column is the scriptname, e.g. "m1q0bstud_2". If the first 
character is a '>' sign, a function within the script was called with an 
ExecuteScript call (e.g. ExecuteScript(1.0f, MyFunction()))
<li>The second column contains the amount of time this script has used up (accumulated).
<li>The third column contains the number of times this script has been called.
